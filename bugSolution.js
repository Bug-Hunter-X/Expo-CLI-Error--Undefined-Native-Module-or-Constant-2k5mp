To fix this, you need to make sure that the library 'expo-camera' is correctly installed and linked (if necessary).

1. **Check Installation:** Ensure the library is installed via:
```bash
expo install expo-camera
```
2. **Expo Managed Workflow:** Expo manages most native modules automatically. If 'expo-camera' is not working after a clean install, double-check the Expo documentation for `expo-camera` to ensure it's compatible with your Expo SDK version.
3. **Verify Expo SDK version:** Make sure your project uses an Expo SDK version compatible with the 'expo-camera' library. Check the library's documentation for compatibility information.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files can cause issues. Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding:
```bash
expo prebuild --clean
expo start
```
5. **(If still not working) Eject (Last Resort):** In rare cases, if all else fails, consider ejecting your project, but this should be the last resort as it significantly alters your project's structure and moves it away from Expo's managed workflow.

Here's the corrected code (assuming correct installation):
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

async function setupCamera() {
  const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
  if (status === 'granted') {
    // Use the camera
  }
}

// ... rest of your component
<Camera style={styles.camera} />
```
Remember to handle permissions as shown above.
