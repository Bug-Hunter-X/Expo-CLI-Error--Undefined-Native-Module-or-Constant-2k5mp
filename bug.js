This error occurs when you try to use a feature from a library that isn't properly linked or installed in your Expo project. This often happens with native modules that require native code compilation.  Here's an example using the react-native-camera library:
```javascript
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

// ... rest of your component
<Camera style={styles.camera} />
```
This code might throw an error similar to `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'Camera.Constants')` or other errors related to the `Camera` component being undefined if 'expo-camera' is not properly configured.
